# 🧠 Content-Based Image Retrieval – Feature Extraction Project

## 📌 Description
This project implements an image analysis and retrieval system based on feature extraction techniques.  
The goal is to extract meaningful visual descriptors from images and compare them to find similar images.

The system uses texture descriptors and similarity distance metrics to perform image comparison and retrieval.
